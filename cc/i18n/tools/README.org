Here are just some simple notes because I feel like I often forget
what various tools in this directory do.  Hopefully I can clean this
up later.

** What the tools do

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
<nkinkade> paroneayea: sync, takes changes in  master/cc_org.po and propagates
           that to all cc-style PO files.
<nkinkade> Then presumably one needs to run cc2po to get the new strings and
           changes from the logically keyed PO files to the the regular
           english-keyed PO files.
<nkinkade> po2cc does the opposite.
<nkinkade> I don't think we use po2cc.py very often because that isn't the
           normal workflow.

** Why cc.i18n is how it is

/These are some poorly formatted notes I took in my last one on one
with Nathan Yergler./

part of carryover from tcl days strings had symbolic representation,
so we've retained a lot of that, which was fine in zope because zope's
i18n translate attributes allows you to specify what to look up in tal:

we looked at moving to pure gettext at some point but the zpt engine
we had to have things substituted into the attributes?  doing the
translation into html and injecting them into the attributes.. when
your translation machinery included html, substitution wouldn't work
in attributes, or into links, etc...

or something.  By using symbolic identifiers that took care of the
problem.

Could also be that having the source text for the key means source
text in the html makes it crazy.. nyergler not sure which of these is
completly true, maybe all :)

hence why the ./bin/sync, because none of those tools handled symbolic
identifiers "right", so we do that part ourselves.
