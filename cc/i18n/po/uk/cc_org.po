"All Creative Commons licenses have many important features in common. Every "

"&mdash; retain copyright while allowing others to copy, distribute, and make"
" some uses of their work &mdash; at least non-commercially. Every Creative "
"Commons license also ensures licensors get the credit for their work they "
"deserve. Every Creative Commons license works around the world and lasts as "
"long as applicable copyright lasts (because they are built on copyright). "
"These common features serve as the baseline, on top of which licensors can "

"A Creative Commons licensor answers a few simple questions on the path to "
